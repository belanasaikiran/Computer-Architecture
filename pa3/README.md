# Programming Assignment 3: Dynamic Branch Prediction & Set Associative Data Cache

A 5-stage pipelined CPU simulator for the RISC-V based riscv-uconn instruction set architecture, including a 4-way set associative data cache and dynamic branch prediction support. The simulator translates machine code created by the riscv-uconn assembler, and executes instructions one at a time. Each instruction goes through a Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Writeback stage of processing.

## Build Instructions
    $ make

## Unit Tests
Several unit tests are provided in the `unittests` directory. These unit tests must be assembled
before use with the simulator. Ensure that the assembler is compiled (this should be done after completing PA0). 
The unit tests can all be assembled by executing the following command in the `pa2` directory:

    $ ../assembler/assembler unittests/unit_test_file.asm <path>/unit_test_file.out

where `unit_test_file` is any of the unit test files (written in riscv-uconn assembly) in the
`unittests` directory. You may also use the provided `assemble_all.sh' script:

    $ bash assemble_all.sh

## Usage
    $ ./simulator assembled_program_file.out FORWARDING_ENABLED DATA_CACHE_ENABLED DYNAMIC_BP_ENABLED

where `assembled_program_file.out` may be any assembled program file generated by the riscv-uconn
assembler, `FORWARDING_ENABLED`, `DATA_CACHE_ENABLED`, `DYNAMIC_BP_ENABLED` and  may be 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled), for 8 total possible combinations.
